        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="em-devtools-vandalism-screenshot.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            The following are changes I made, thoughts I had while making these changes, and reflection on my deepened understanding of HTML, CSS, and devtools.
        <ul>
            <li>For this exercise, I edited the team names and title of main page story.</li>
            <li>I modified the text size of the team names to 10px, changed the color of the team names to pink, and 
                changed the heading for the main story. </li>
            <li>The names and event made my vandalism silly and fun, and that also speaks to the basis for me choosing 
                the changes I did.
            </li>
            <li>I understood why the changes I made worked since we have learned how changing particular aspects 
                affects the overall web page. The only thing I did nto understand why it did not work was that ESPN's 
                website had a short name and long name designation for the team names. Changing short name changed the 
                webpage but changing long name did not. </li>
            <li>This game me a much better understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create a webpage. Both the syntax
                and style go hand in hand for making a webpage everything you want it to be. I learned that so many aspect can 
                be edited to make a truly customized final product. For me, this reminded me of our previous exercises in week 1 
                thinking of why making one's own webpage from scratch is important. It truly is an art.
            </li>
            <li>I now understanmd how devtools can be used to edit a webpage, whether it be temporaqrily and for fun, like we 
                have done in this exercise or for more serious use, like changing things on our personal webpages to fit a particular
            aesthetic or honoring a particular day/event. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
