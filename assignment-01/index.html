        <h1>Kanye West's Best Albums</h1>

            <h2>Late Registration (2005)</h2>
            <p>Kanye's absolute best album in my opinion has to be Late Registration. Any album, even one made 
                by your favorite artist, usually has at least one or two songs you'd skip...but not this one. 
                From beginning to end (even the 4 additional hidden tracks)...NOTHING BUT HITS! It boasts a 
                variety of musical syles and sounds. For example, "Drive Slow" features a Houston style beat 
                and rap while "Late" highlights a sped up sample from soul group, The Whatnauts, and a solo 
                violin. Definitely his best and most diverse body of work. </p>

            <h2>College Dropout (2004)</h2>
            <p>Last, but not least is The College Dropout, Kanye's first studio album. This album features 
                artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, Common, and Jamie Foxx. Previously known only for his production,
                this album introduces us to Kanye, the artist. It also features his own production and brings a
                different look and sound to rap culture. Kanye came onto the scene unique and unapologetic, beginning
                a successful musical career.</p>
